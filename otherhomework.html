<h3>The Story of Overlord</h3>
<p>Created by Kugane Maruyama originally as a web novel series that got massively popular, Overlord gradually took the step from being a humble web novel, turning into a series of light novel, and then finally having an anime serialized from its success. There are currently three ongoing seasons for the anime, and a fourth one is planning to go underway. The concept of 'main character being transported into a game world' isn't at all new or uncommon. However, Overlord, to me, achieved it in such a weirdly nostalgic way that got me instantly hooked from the get go. Perhaps the series isn't for everyone, but for me, it helped me remember some of the best times of my life gaming with family and friends in a similar manner.</p>

<p>I won't spoil too much about this amazing series, though I will certainly talk about what I like! To start off, I would like to talk about the setup and basis of the story, and why it can be relatable to a lot of people.</p>
<p>If you are also a person that likes to play games with friends, I think the protagonist will be very relatable in that aspect. Imagine spending years building up towards making your guild one of the top guilds in the game, putting countless hours and resources into something you enjoy and love. But then gradually, everything cannot stay the same as your friends soon have their own lives that they need to live, leaving you behind with all the memories that you all built throughout the years. I know the feeling very well. I have played a lot of games with my friends and family, and there is always a wistful sense of nostalgia whenever I remember what we used to do. I have been in the same position where I, alone, were continuing on playing just to try and get some of that wonderful feeling of doing what I used to love doing with my closest people together. But how can that ever compare to having your friends doing it with you?</p>

<p>The protagonist is playing Yggdrasil, the game we see in the beginning of the story, as an escape from how crappy reality is. A lot of people can relate to that, I'm sure. He had no family left in the real world, or any friends, only a soul sucking job in a depressing world that honestly sounds like a place anybody would want to get away from. As a person outside of his game persona, he seems like a really broken, lonely, and socially awkward guy. His guild and guildmates gave him life, a reason to live, and people to enjoy that life with. It's no wonder he would do anything to preserve those memories when everything else looks so bleak for him. If you can get away from the world for a few hours a day, being whoever and whatever you want, doing whatever you like with the people you considered family, then why wouldn't you want to preserve that happiness for as long as you can?</p>
<p>When reading the novel, there is a lingering sense of dread that the readers could feel. The main character's beloved game is about to be shut down forever after so many years of TLC to its player and community. I can imagine going online for the last time, being somewhere that you're so strongly attached to and hoping for your friends to reminisce one last time with you, but then no one came. It must have been terribly lonely; the ones who did come didn't stay for long, either. However, the darkness and despair isn't the only thing there is. There is also the sense of discovery, of finding yourself again. The protagonist of our book got transported into a completely strange world when the game didn't force him out after the designated shut down time. When this happened, the novel deviated into this adventure type genre where we as readers learned more about this completely foreign world along with the characters. Which, in my humble opinion, is a great way to tell a story where we slowly learn about things rather than having too much information unloaded on us at once.</p>

<p>The world of Overlord is very dark for its inhabitants. But readers can enjoy a fresh take on the Isekai genre with the vast and complex world building with the many complex layers of social classes. We get to see how different societies of this new world has different ways of life, making this series' universe feels really alive. If you want to escape to another place, or simply to read a good nerdy novel series, I think you would really enjoy this series! I would reccommend checking out the light novels first, and then buy the manga or watch the anime if you really get into the series!</p>
