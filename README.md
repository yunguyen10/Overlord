# Overlord
Basic Website about Overlord
In a small project assigned by PIRPLE web development class, I was tasked to create a basic website to talk about a book or series that I liked utilizing basic and common HTML tags. 
The tags utilized in this block of code are a basic front end level, and it's very plain and easy to track when you inspect the site's element. 
In this project, the code created is meant to display and present. 
The most common tags used in this are unordered list <ul>, list element <li>, paragraph <p>, image <img>, and anchor <a>. 

These are crucial elements for texts, graphics, lists, and external links to another site. 
Throughout the website, the <p> tags are used to describe and inform the readers of what the novel is and why I like them. 
Tags meant for extra stylings such as bolding <strong>, italics <i>, or subtext <small> are also utilized, and it adds a little bit of spice to plain text areas. 
After the introduction to the novels, 
the final thing I did is including media and store links where the readers could look into buying or watching the animated series if they would like. 
With a combination of <ul>, <li> and <a> tags, the links are anchor to texts in an organized and straightforward manner.
